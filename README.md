Facial Emotion Detection  Using Deep Learning
 Facial Emotion Recognition is used to classify the emotional states of a human. 
The objective is to group every facial picture into one of the seven facial emotion 
classes like Surprise, Sad, Neutral, Happy, Fear, Disgust and Angry. It is used in 
crucial tasks like human-computer interaction,in mental health 
analysis.Therefore, there is a need for accurate and efficient automated methods 
for emotion detection.The aim of the project is to develop deeplearning model 
using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the emotions.
